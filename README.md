# AI Recipe

Starting with Scrapy to gather data off recipe websites. I want to eventually expand off this and start to use the data with NLP and time series methodologies to create interesting use cases with the data. This includes:

* Auto-generation of recipes
* Combinations of ingredients that might go well together
* Auto-labeling of cuisine, etc.
* Modification of recipes to be of a different cuisine (kind of like style changing in CNNs)
* Healthy alternatives to recipes (maybe use recipes labeled as healthy and auto-modify recipes to be more like those)
